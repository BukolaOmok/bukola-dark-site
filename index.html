    <h2>Overview
    </h2>
    <p class = "Paragraph"> When two children go missing in a small German town, its sinful past is exposed along with the double lives and
      fractured relationships that exist among four families as they search for the kids. The mystery-drama series
      introduces an intricate puzzle filled with twists that includes a web of curious characters, all of whom have a
      connection to the town's troubled history -- whether they know it or not. The story includes supernatural elements
      that tie back to the same town in 1986. "Dark" represents the first German original series produced for Netflix.
